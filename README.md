# PyLibby, a CLI for Libby

This tool lets you borrow, download and return (audio)books from [Libby](https://libbyapp.com) (OverDrive). 
You can download audiobooks without the extra step of getting the ODM file first.


## How to run PyLibby
You can use pipenv, first install the stuff in the Pipfile (you only need to do this the first time):
```bash
pipenv install
```
Then run PyLibby like this
```bash
pipenv run python pylibby.py -h
```

Alternatively you can run PyLibby without pipenv, but make sure you have 
installed the requirements, "requests" and "tabulate"


You need to log in before you can start using PyLibby. 
You can do this by logging in to Libby on any device and
going to Settings->Copy To Another Device.
You will get a code there which you can use like this:

```bash
python pylibby.py -c 12345678
```

To check if you are logged in you can try listing your loans like this:
```bash
python pylibby.py -ls
```

To download a book you need to specify the format and output path. 
For audiobooks the format will always be "audiobook-mp3".
```bash
python pylibby.py -dl 654321 -f audiobook-mp3 -o /home/username/books
```
You can search for books like this:
```bash
python pylibby.py -s "moby dick"
```

## Doesn't work?
As I mainly use Libby for audiobooks this tool is focused on that. 
If you want to download ebooks your best bet is to try the "ebook-epub-adobe"-format
and use something like [Knock](https://web.archive.org/web/20221016154220/https://github.com/BentonEdmondson/knock).
Unfortunately it was removed from GitHub, but you can still download it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20221020182238/https://github.com/BentonEdmondson/knock/releases).
Most other formats will just print out a link you can open in your browser.

This tool has only been tested on Linux, I don't know if it will run on other OS's.


## Info
* There's a swagger API with documentation [here](https://thunder-api.overdrive.com/docs/ui/index), but I couldn't get everything to work.
* "ebook-overdrive"-format (Libby web reader) is mostly a regular epub. The book is base64encoded in .xhtml files which we can get. I think most of the toc.ncx file can be reconstructed from openbook.json. Every book could in theory be downloaded this way, then we wouldn't need to bother with acsm's and so on.
* "ebook-kobo"-format is often/always listed as available even if it isn't...? I don't have a device I can test with and I don't know how it works.
* You can still get an ODM file by using ```-odm```


## Thanks to
* Overdrive for their service.
* The Norwegian libraries that are a part of Overdrive.


## Legal
This program is not authorized by Overdrive/Libby. It does not intentionally circumvent any 
restrictions in Overdrive's or Libby's services, 
but instead works in the same way as their own software. 
This means that you will need a valid library card and also a license for 
each book you download (you need to have "borrowed" them). 
PyLibby does not remove DRM from files it downloads.
